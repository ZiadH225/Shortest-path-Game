## Shortest Path Game using BFS Algorithm with SFML Library (C++)

This project implements a Shortest Path Game using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in C++, utilizing the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and user interaction.

### Description

The Shortest Path Game is a simple application where the user navigates a character through a maze to reach a goal while finding the shortest path. The application visualizes the maze and the character movement using SFML graphics.

### Need-To-Know

- **Dynamic Maze Modification**: Follow these instructions to be able to modify your maze. 
  - **Player Position**: Left-click (mouse) + S to change the player position.
  - **End Point**: Left-click (mouse) + E to set the end point.
  - **Wall Creation**: Right-click (mouse) to add a wall cell.
  - **Wall Removal**: Right-click (mouse) on a wall to remove a wall cell.
  - **Run the Game**: Press R to run the game after modifying the maze.

### Requirements
- C++ compiler
- SFML library
